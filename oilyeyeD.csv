"Cleanse away the day with the Luna™ Mini 2 from FOREO. This tool uses T-sonic pulsations to unclog pores, removing up to 99.5% of oil, dirt, makeup and dead skin. The pulsations are trans-dermal, propelling a force deep into the pore for a thorough cleanse. This not only purifies your complexion, it enhances its absorption of other products, such as moisturisers and toners, boosting every step of your skincare routine.
Designed with varying touch points for different areas of skin, this product is perfect for those with combination skin types, or those who are unsure. The thicker touch points are for precision cleaning of oily areas, while the thinner points at the front are for gently cleansing sensitive areas. Super soft and extra gentle, the Luna Mini 2 stops your from over cleaning or harming your skin, as you might with a rough flannel. Crafted from the highest grade of silicone, the Luna is 35x more hygienic than nylon bristle brushes, and its non-porous surface prevents the build-up of bacteria.
The mini size is super portable, fitting in your bag for post-gym cleansing or long weekends. Making your skincare routine effortless, a 1-minute cleanse leaves an all-day glow and a single charge provides 300 uses (that’s 5 months if you use it twice a day), making your life just a little bit easier. You can even personalise the intensity according to your skin type using adjustor on the front of the device.
Skin is left softer, smoother and firmer. Spice up your skincare routine and enjoy a brighter, healthier and younger-looking complexion.
Hypoallergenic
Cruelty-free.",Overall Rating : 5.0 / 5 (2 Reviews),Top Customer Reviews,"I started using this after it became more difficult to get Clarisonic brush heads. I feel like the Foreo is much more enjoyable to use and does such a good job at cleansing my skin. My face, neck & décolletage are so much cleaner and smoother since incorporating this tool into my routine, I don’t think I would want to live without it now. As well as being highly effective in its function, it’s also very sanitary.","20/04/20
